<p class="abouthomeopathy"> Homeopathy originated in Germany, but it shares a
     basic concept with Acupuncture, which came from China. The idea is 
     that the vital energy that keeps the body alive and well, can be disrupted or thrown out of balance, 
    which leads to illness. Acupuncture attempts to bring the energy back to normal by inserting 
    needles at specific points on the body. Homeopathy uses specially prepared, energy 
    medicines taken by mouth, to achieve the same end. Both systems work, but, in our opinion, homeopathy
     is to be preferred for a number of reasons. For one, it involves no pain. Furthermore, it does not require the 
     client to spend long sessions at the practitioner's office. We recommend Acupuncture to potential clients who are not 
     willing to give up their coffee habits. Coffee can disrupt the action of our medicines. </p>

     <p class = "hahnemann"> Homeopathy was developed by a German M.D. named Samuel Hahnemann, at the end of 
        the eighteenth century. He had quit regular medicine to work as a translator because the methods 
        that doctors used then were largely harmful. He ran across something in translating that gave 
        him the idea for an experiment. The results led to his creating a new form of medicine, which he 
        called homeopathy. More can be found on this at the website of the National Center for 
        Homeopathy. The new medicine spread throughout Europe rapidly and came to the U.S. in 1833. </p>

    <h1 class="aboutjm"> About James Midgley </h1>
    <p class="aboutjmtext">
        James discovered homeopathy in 1989, while seeking help for chronic fatigue syndrome.
        The spectacular results of homeopathy led him to study homeopathy formally. He was fortunate to
        study under a leading American homeopath, Linda M. Johnston, MD. Later, he received instruction
        from master homeopath, Ananda Zaren. James began practicing in a small way, in 1991, with friends 
        and family. When the California legislature passed alternative medicine bill, SB 577, in 2003, James 
        established an online presence with a website. In 2021 he achieved national certification, earning the 
        offical title, Certified Classical Homeopath (CCH).
